Assume each worker has no slot limit.
Assume worker synchronisation is randomly distributed.
Assume execution much slower than pickup (e.g. decay ignored).
Investigate the effect of the ratio of switching times on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Time to empty queue
\item Balance between workers
\end{enumerate}
Fix no work poll interval to 1.
With these algorithms workers take an average of half a second to discover work has been queued.

The average time before any worker notices queued work is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{w}
\end{equation}

The average time one worker takes to empty a queue of $l$ items is:
\begin{equation}
0.5 + \frac{l - 2}{n}
\end{equation}

Once switched each worker pulls work at a rate of n per second until the queue is empty.
Therefore the emptying rate (once all workers are engaged) is $nw$ (where $w$ is no of workers).
Because the first one will be next to pull again we don't have to worry about the others.
Once the first switches the probability that all workers will switch before it pulls work again is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n}^{w - 1}
\end{equation}
